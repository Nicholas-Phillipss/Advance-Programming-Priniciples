/*
The purpose of this assignment is for students to become familiar with 
strings, c-string, arrays, structure data, and conditional statements. For 
this assignment, we used structured data to hold data types of each of 
the six players (name, number, and points). Then, the program will loop 
through a for loop asking the user to input the name, number, and points 
scored by each of the six players. Once each playerâ€™s data is recorded, all 
the information will be presented in a table. Once the table is printed out, the 
program will then add up all the player's points to find the total points by the 
team using a for a loop. Lastly, the program will then find the player who scored 
the highest amount of points using a for loop and if statement. This information will then be 
printed out displaying the player's name and number.
